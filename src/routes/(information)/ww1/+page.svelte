	<p class="body">
		World War One was a key event in the world's history. It involved many of the  worlds' countries and caused countless casualties.
	It was a horrific event that rocked the entire world. It was known as the "Great War" at the time, because humanity had never experienced anything like it before.
		The years of 1914-1918 changed the world and geopolitical landscape - such as creating new countries like Poland and making empires fall.
	</p>
	<h2 class="heading">Why did it start?</h2>
	<p class="body">
		The <em>Greatest</em> War at the time started because a gang of young men implored to cause havoc, unaware of its oncoming domino effect.
		They planned to assassinate the <strong>Archduke of Austria-Hungary - Franz Ferdindand</strong>
